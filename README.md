Yap is the lightweight microservices API gateway with GraphQL that shines at the heart of any microservices or serverless architecture, which aims to be a smaller, more expressive, and more robust foundation with low-code approach and security entreprise-gradle.

Please distinguish **Yap** (the core project of Young App) and **YAP** (the platform of Young App).

## Motivation
Young App helps to automate business workflows across cloud and on-premise apps providing employees with prompt communication and building in teams sophisticated collaboration. As an illustration, YAP automates quotes processing for cash business, which may involve multiple apps.

Without API Management, we are using Express, Koa or Hapi on Nodejs without security handler, and all others NodeJS frameworks are based on http module, yap is different, designed only for serverless functions (event-driven) and GraphQL.
 
## Key features of Yap üôå
Yap offers powerful, yet lightweight features that allow fine-grained control over your API ecosystem.

* **Elegants XML Policies** ‚Äì Policies are a powerful capability of the system that allow the publisher to change API behavior through configuration in elegants with XML
* **GraphQL as API Gateway** ‚Äì GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. Yap use only GraphQL as API Gateway.
* **API Connectors** ‚Äì YAP is the only integration platform that was built from the ground to support a single design interface for developer/IT and for citizen integrators.

## Installing
It's an official version for JavaScript, available for Node.js backends, Serverless and AWS Lambda.

###### With yarn
```
yarn add @youngapp/yap
```

###### With npm
```
npm install @youngapp/yap
```

## Hello API
Yap application is an object containing resolvers functions and policies which are composed and executed in a stack-like manner upon request. Yap is similar to many other middleware systems that you may have encountered such as Koa, Connect.

#### Minimalist application with http.Server
```typescript
import { Yap } from "@youngapp/yap";
import typeDefs from "./schema.graphql";
import resolvers from "./resolvers.ts";

// Your schema definition and resolvers GraphQL
const app = new Yap({ typeDefs, resolvers });

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!')
})
```

#### With AWS Lambda
```typescript
import { Yap } from "@youngapp/yap";
import typeDefs from "./schema.graphql";
import resolvers from "./resolvers.ts";

// Your schema definition and resolvers GraphQL
const app = new Yap({ typeDefs, resolvers });

// A simple handler for AWS Lambda.
exports.handler = app.handler;
```
