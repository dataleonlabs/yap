Yap is the lightweight microservices API gateway in GraphQL that shines at the heart of any microservices or serverless architecture, which aims to be a smaller, more expressive, and more robust foundation for API management and automation workflows with low-code approach and security entreprise-gradle.

Please distinguish **Yap** (the core project of Young App) and **YAP** (the platform of Young App).

## Motivation
Young App helps to automate business workflows across cloud and on-premise apps providing employees with prompt communication and building in teams sophisticated collaboration. As an illustration, YAP automates quotes processing for cash business, which may involve multiple apps.

Without API Management, we are using Express, Koa or Hapi on Nodejs without security handler, and all others NodeJS frameworks are based on http module, yap is different, designed only for serverless functions (event-driven) and GraphQL.

Yap combines the enterprise-grade api management and workflow automation platform and ease of use expected from client apps supporting on cloud-based with GraphQL and Policies.

## Architecture
YAP combines GraphQL, XML policies and strong functional testing on serverless architecture.

* **Error handling with Policies** ‚Äì Sentry provides self-hosted and cloud-based error monitoring that helps all software
teams discover, triage, and prioritize errors in real-time.
* **Connectors** ‚Äì YAP is the only integration platform that was built from the ground to support a single design interface for developer/IT and for citizen integrators.
* **Universal middleware design** ‚Äì Inspired by Express or KoaJS and adapted for Serverless application and low-code approach.
* **Designed for Serverless** ‚Äì Yap is designed for serverless event functions on AWS, GCP or Azure Functions.
* **TypeScript** ‚Äì YAP is written in NodeJS and TypeScript, which makes it fast and easy to set up.
